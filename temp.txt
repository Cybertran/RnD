Calls
callbacks
or
notifications
to
error
handling
objects
can
be
useful
when
you
need
to
offload
error
processing
operations
to
centralized
handlers
because
an
exception
in
one
thread
or
one
part
of
a
system
requires
compensating
actions
in
other
threads
or
other
parts
of
a
system
that
wouldn
t
otherwise
be
known
to
the
method
catching
the
exception
They
can
also
be
used
to
make
code
more
extensible
and
more
resilient
when
used
by
clients
that
cannot
be
expected
to
know
how
to
respond
to
failures
However
some
care
is
needed
when
replacing
exceptions
with
callbacks
events
and
related
notification
techniques
When
they
escape
the
stack
based
flow
of
control
rules
of
exceptions
their
use
can
make
it
more
difficult
to
predict
and
manage
responses
to
failure
across
different
parts
of
a
system
